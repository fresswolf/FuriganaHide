# FuriganaHide
## Incentive
Written Japanese consists of three writing systems, which are all combined together even within the same sentence. While Hiragana (ひらがな) and Katakana (カタカナ) are phonetic systems, Kanji (漢字) were adopted from Chinese characters and their phonetic reading depend on the context, with some characters having up to 14 different readings.
To help learners of the language, young native speakers included, the Japanese use Furigana (振り仮名), small phonetic characters (usually Hiragana) written above kanji characters.
While Furigana are quite helpful to the beginner of the Japanese language, they can prevent intermediate to advanced learners from actually solidifying their kanji reading ability. Therefore, an on demand kanji reading display method is encouraged for learners of all levels.
